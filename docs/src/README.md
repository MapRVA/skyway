# Introduction

skyway is a command-line OpenStreetMap file converter.

<div class="warning">
skyway is currently in <a href="https://semver.org/">major version (0.y.z)</a>, i.e. it is undergoing initial development.
While I hope you find skyway helpful, it might not work as expected.
Your feedback and contributions are welcome. Thanks!

## Goals

- Support a wide range of OpenStreetMap file formats
- Provide a user-friendly tag filtering system, capable of scaling to planet-scale data
- ~Be fast~ *(currently focusing on adding features, performance will come later!)*

## Alternatives

Before adopting skyway for your project, please also consider [Osmium Tool](https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/), a well-trusted and performant application that accomplishes many of the same things.

For a complete list of alternatives, please see the [OSM file formats page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_file_formats) on the OpenStreetMap wiki.
