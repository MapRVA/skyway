# Installation

## Pre-compiled Binaries

Builds of skyway are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/MapRVA/skyway/releases).
Feel free to get in touch if you'd like me to prepare a binary for your platform.

## Install Using Cargo

skyway is [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/skyway), so you can install it using cargo:

Make sure your cargo bin directory is in your $PATH.
